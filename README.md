# vanilla-visio-app

A Google Meet-style application that leverages the power of WebRTC for transmitting audio and video in real-time with peer-to-peer connections.

Compared to the original version, made with React, this version is made with just vanilla JS. 
This was to compare how we use WebRTC in both technologies.
